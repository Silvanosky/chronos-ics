# Chronos ICS

Provide ICS files for chronos @ EPITA (http://chronos.epita.net/)
Only for Promo 2020 (S1)

I will maybe add a semester and group selector.

You can also edit the list in cron.py to select what you want (like in the search field on the website)

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execute

```
python cron.py
```
